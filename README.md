```
[TEST1]: Please read all the lines to understand the usage.
         
[test2]: unaltered text, a.k.a .upper() not applied to the string.
         
[TEST4]: using click.echo as the print function

[TEST3]: using sys.stderr.write as the print function

( TEST5 ): using custom frame characters
           
[TEST6:0]: By defining a 'counter_start',
[TEST6:1]: a counter number will be appended
[TEST6:2]: to the prefix.
           
[TEST7:1]: Different prefix printers can have different counters.
[TEST6:3]: As you see in this example,
[TEST7:2]: they have do not interfere with each other.
           
[TEST8:10]: Global counters can also be set.
[TEST8:11]: However, if any prefix printers has already been defined,
[TEST8:12]: you have to set global_redefine to True.
[TEST6:4]: But as you can see here,
[TEST6:5]: global counters still doesn't interfere with local counters.
           
[TEST9:13]: New prefix_printers will pick up the last global count, which can
[TEST9:14]: be handy with different prefixes should be used with sequential counting.
            
[TEST1]: With new lines in strings the text is converted
         to multiline, then all but the first are
         indented to line up with the rest.
         
[TEST1]: The next example wil not be ending with a `:`, since it has no input.
